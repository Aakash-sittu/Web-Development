            <p>Steven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 â€“ October 5, 2011) was an American entrepreneur, industrial designer,
                business magnate, media proprietor, and investor. He was the co-founder, chairman, and CEO of Apple; the
                chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar; a member of The Walt Disney Company's board of directors
                following its acquisition of Pixar; and the founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT. He is widely recognized
                as a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with his early business
                partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.

                Jobs was born in San Francisco to a Syrian father and German-American mother. He was adopted shortly
                after his birth. Jobs attended Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he
                traveled through India seeking enlightenment and studying Zen Buddhism. He and Wozniak co-founded Apple
                in 1976 to sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Together the duo gained fame and wealth a year
                later with production and sale of the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced
                microcomputers. Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and
                had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in
                1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The
                Macintosh introduced the desktop publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter,
                the first laser printer to feature vector graphics.</p>
